# Hadoop-Movie-Recommender

This movie recommender works in conjunction with each other where each number represents which files should be executed in which order.
To get the inputs for each stage you must execute the previous stage and use the output result for the next stage.
For example: Output for stage 1 is the input for stage 2.
